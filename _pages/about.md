Hi! This is Ryan's home on the web! Welcome!

Currently, I am a master student at New York University(NYU). My research interests lie in time series, machine learning, exchange rate forecasting, etc. My professional interests lie in industry research, consulting.

Personal Hobbies
------
I am an amateur marathon enthusiast. I have been jogging since 2016 and participate in a half-marathon or full-marathon event every year on average. Due to the impact of the epidemic, I have been participating in online marathon running activities. I especially enjoy the feeling of slight fatigue after running 8 kilometers in the mountains, and I hope someone can run with me.
